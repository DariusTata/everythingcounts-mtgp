A key prompt for the Everything Counts assignment 1 was to pick something which interests you.
This repo was my initial idea - investigate tournament deck data for Magic the Gathering Pro play.
It became clear though that much of this project would be data management/structuring/restructuring.
This was not very appealing to me, nor would it garner many marks when graded - so I dropped the idea.
My final submission for the Everything Counts assignment 1 is availible in another public repo of mine.
